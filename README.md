# Excel_project
Designed a detailed Excel dashboard to track and visualize monthly and yearly financial expenses across various categories like living, transport, dining, and medical. Used pivot tables, slicers, and dynamic charts (bar, pie, column) for clear comparisons, category-wise breakdowns, and interactive data filtering.
